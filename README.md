1. Option 1: Include them in the GitHub action. This would be beneficial for several reasons. The tests run automatically and immediately getting feedback before merging. They could also be integrated with pull requests, which ensure that only good quality code is able to be merged. If the tests are manually run locally, others would not be able to see it and it wouldn't be recorded in GitHub. Running them after pushing it is risky as another commit and merge would be required if the tests don't pass. 

2. No. End to end tests are more for mimicking how the user would use the application and testing that all of the steps work as follows. They wouldn't necessarily be able to see if the correct output is returned or not.
